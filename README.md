The API currently only runs on Python 3.9. Make sure to run the API using this version of Python as some packages used will not work with other versions of Python. 

Configure `config/dbConn.ini` file according to your database. 

remark: `theflyingdutchman.sql` file only adds the tables, not the database itself



Run API: `API_3.py`

remark: Endpoint SpoofShip won't work without the transmit-receive setup configured and actively running
